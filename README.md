# João Afonso Silva

Hello! My name is João Afonso, and I enjoy learning about new tech and programming. 
I have a master's in Mechanical Engineering but decided to change my career and pursue software development.

I've recently finished a Web Development Bootcamp by [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com), and I'm currently aiming to gain more knowledge and working experience as a web developer.

## Skills

Java / Spring / Angular / HTML / CSS / TS
